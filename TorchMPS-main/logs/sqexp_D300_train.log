Device: cuda
Prefix: sqexp_D300, max_degree=10, N_targets=20
Using N_base=20 base points out of 20, D=300
Using N_T_NODES=11 Chebyshev nodes in t for path augmentation.
Generating path-augmented dataset...
Path-augmented dataset size (h + g_i paths): 66220 points = (1 + D)*N_base*N_T_NODES

Training MPS on path-augmented regression
D_aug=301, bond_dim=60, N_train=66220 (no held-out test set)


⚠️  Detected divergence (loss explosion).
Stopping at epoch 1. Restoring best model from epoch 0 (MSE=inf, R²=-inf)

⚠️ No best_state recorded; using last epoch parameters.
Saved TN-SHAP targets and t-nodes to sqexp_D300_tnshap_targets.pt
Saved trained MPS to sqexp_D300_mps.pt
Done.
